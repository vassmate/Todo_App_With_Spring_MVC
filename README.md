# Todo App With Spring MVC
This is a simple todo web app, which covers the basic CRUD operations.

# Description
The application responses with either a JSON object or .jsp page depending on the method call. The default view is .jsp so the create, update, delete operations have their own default .jsp pages confirming if those operations were successfull.
Input field validations and handling of the possible exceptions are still in progress.
